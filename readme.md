# CarouselProject

A project in which I have been asked to create a web Carousel from scratch.

I will be using [**Inuit**](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) for the css styling along with [**SASS**](http://sass-lang.com/).

I will also be using [**Gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/) as the task runner.

### ITCSS

    -------------   SETTINGS    (Variable declarations)
     -----------    TOOLS       (functions, mixins, placeholders)
      ---------     GENERIC     (resets)
       -------      BASE        (tag defaults)
        -----       OBJECTS     (patterns e.g. grid systems, tiles)
         ---        COMPONENTS  (component level styling)
          -         TRUMPS      (!importants)

## INSALLATION

    run npm install
    run gulp (check that gulp will compile the sass)
    run gulp browser:watch (to boot up browser sync)
